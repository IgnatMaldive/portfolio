[{"content":"The Barcelona Activa Chatbot is a digital assistant created to enhance user interaction on the Barcelona Activa website. Barcelona Activa is the economic development agency of the Barcelona City Council. The goal of this project is to provide users with a seamless and efficient way to access information and resources related to economic development in Barcelona.\nMethodology Data Collection:\nRelevant content from the Barcelona Activa website was collected using web scraping techniques. This content served as the basis for training the chatbot.\nContent Processing:\nThe Recursive Character Text Splitter method was employed to organize the scraped content effectively. This process aimed to improve the chatbot\u0026rsquo;s understanding and responsiveness to user queries.\nContent Embedding:\nThe processed content was embedded into a vector database using Pinecone, a vector database platform. This enabled efficient retrieval and matching of user queries.\nBot Training:\nThe Langchain LLM framework, along with OpenAI Embeddings, was used to train the chatbot. The bot was programmed to understand user queries and generate appropriate responses by leveraging the embedded content and links.\nImages Links Demo BCN Activa Chatbot.\nTechnologies Used Python: Python programming language was used for various data processing and scripting tasks. Javascript: JavaScript was employed for frontend integration and user interaction components. Langchain LLM: This framework was used to structure and train the chatbot\u0026rsquo;s language capabilities. Flowise: Flowise technology was used to streamline user interactions and conversation flow. OpenAI Embeddings: OpenAI Embeddings were employed to enhance the chatbot\u0026rsquo;s understanding of textual content. Pinecone Vector Database: used for efficient storage and retrieval of embedded content.

In the power station, a power inverter converts the 12 volts DC into 220 volts AC, thus allowing us to power any electrical device. At Pedal Power we do not have batteries nor do we carry any other source of energy other than the one provided by the public.\n","date":"2019-02-09T00:00:00Z","image":"https://ignatmaldive.github.io/portfolio23_new/p/pedal-power/pedal_power_hu9104e5928d3887d622d0d4534d343b0e_167222_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://ignatmaldive.github.io/portfolio23_new/p/pedal-power/","title":"Pedal Power"},{"content":"MiniATM is a compact and simple Bitcoin Cash ATM.
